## Introduction

This application was created by me, Allan HipÃ³lito. It allows users to explore and watch YouTube videos in an intuitive and dynamic way. Utilizing Node.js, Prisma, and deployed on Railway, the gallery features a sleek and responsive interface, seamlessly integrating high-quality and diverse content from YouTube.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Vite**: A build tool that boasts a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript, offering static type-checking and the latest ECMAScript features.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and more to style your websites without leaving your HTML.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **PrismaORM**: Prisma ORM is an open-source next-generation ORM.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **TypeScript**: Brings static typing to JavaScript, ensuring a more predictable runtime behavior.
- **Jest**: Used for writing unit and integration tests for the backend.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. 

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7ipolito/project-gallery-youtube.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:

   ```bash
   cd project-gallery-youtube
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   - For Frontend:
   
     ```bash
     cd frontend && npm install
     ```

   - For Backend:

     ```bash
     cd backend && npm install
     ```

## Running the Application

- **To run the frontend**:

  ```bash
  npm run start-frontend
  ```

  This starts the React application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

- **To run the backend**:

  ```bash
  npm run start-backend
  ```

  This initializes the Express server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **To run both simultaneously**:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

  This will invoke `concurrently` to start both the front and back ends.

Ensure that the frontend and backend are configured to run on separate ports to avoid conflicts.

## Conclusion

This application, created by me, Allan HipÃ³lito, allows users to explore and watch YouTube videos dynamically. It features a sleek interface where users can seamlessly navigate related videos from their initial selection. The project is currently 80% complete, with ongoing enhancements to enrich the user experience.
